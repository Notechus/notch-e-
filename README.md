# notch-e-
It's my noob attempt to create simple game engine notch[e]

That's what is covered so far:
1. Window
2. GLFW, GLEW init
3. Input
4. Vectors(Vec2,Vec3,Vec4)
5. Matrices
6. Shaders(basic)
7. Buffers(buffer, indexbuffer, colorbuffer?)
8. Simple Renderer
9. Ultra-Fast Batch Renderer
10. Optimization
11. Layers
12. 

Currently learning some physics to work with physics engine.
