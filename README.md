# notch-e-
It's my noob attempt to create simple game engine notch[e]

That's what is covered so far:
1. Window </br>
2. GLFW, GLEW init</br>
3. Input</br>
4. Vectors(Vec2,Vec3,Vec4)</br>
5. Matrices</br>
6. Shaders(basic)</br>
7. Buffers(buffer, indexbuffer, colorbuffer?)</br>
8. Simple Renderer</br>
9. Ultra-Fast Batch Renderer</br>
10. Optimization</br>
11. Layers</br>
12.</br> 

Currently learning some physics to work with physics engine.
